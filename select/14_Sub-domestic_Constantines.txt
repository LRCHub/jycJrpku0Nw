Put this confession in your sensitive files
Here's some kindling for the schizophrenics
The new sick sleepless ex-patriot congress is living sub sub sub-domestic
If sanctuary still exists
Its among the shaking fists
Seeking out a living free of the postures of politics

Plant a paint bombs in the market
Sing it to the whispering bats
Beneath the poison traffic, caught up in the wires

Echolocation
Call your targets out by name
Spraycans and stencils, moonrats and flowerpot snakes
If sanctuary still exists
Its among the shaking fists

Seeking out a living free of the postures of politics
Reconstructive scavengers
Termite sympathizers
All sick and sleepless
Caught up in the wires
